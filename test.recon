<- Hello, my name is Recon. What can I do for you today?
1> What is Recon?
<- That doesn't seem like a very polite way to start a 
   conversation. I am Recon.
1> I mean, why are you called Recon?
<- "Recon" stands for "readable conversation". It's the 
   format that this conversation is written in.
!B qs
  1> Who invented Recon? And can I meet them?
    <- Recon was designed by Alex Macmillan as a way to quickly
       write and proofread conversation trees.
      1> Fascinating.
        <- Anything else you'd like to know?
          !J qs
      2> This is cool and all, but actually, I have to go.
        !Q
  2> What is Recon's purpose?
    <- To provide a way to quickly and easily write complex 
       conversation scripts.
    <- Recon supports multiple page monologues.
    <- As you have already seen, Recon supports conversation
       choices.
    <- As you may have already discovered, Recon allows 
       conversation to loop back so that the player can ask
       multiple questions.
      1> Enough about this already.
        !J qs
      2> Go on.
        <- I will, thanks. Most importantly, Recon scripts
           are easy to read and to write. This could be essential 
           when writing conversation scripts for large numbers of 
           characters, where the player has a lot of freedom to 
           move conversations in interesting directions.

  3> Pretty interesting stuff. It was nice meeting you!
    <- And it was nice meeting you too. Have a good day!
